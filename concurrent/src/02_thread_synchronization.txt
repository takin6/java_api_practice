Java's buit-in monitors
- Every object has a monitor and a monitor lock
- THe monitor ensures that its object's monitor lock
  is held by a maximum of only one thread at any time
- Used to enforce mutual exclusion

- To specify that a thread must hold a monitor lock
  to esxecute a block of code, the code should be
  placed in a synchronized statement
  synchronized(object) {}
