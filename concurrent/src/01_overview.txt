Tasks Executing in Parallel
- Two tasks operating in parallel are executing simultaniously
- subset of concurrency
- Multi-core computers have multiple processors that can perform tasks in parallel

Multithreading
- Java makes concurrecy available to you through the language and APIS
- Java programs can have multiple threads of execution
- Each thread has its own method-call stack and program counter,
  allwing it to execute concurrently with other threads

Parallel vs. Concurrent
- Concurrent（並行）は「複数の動作が、論理的に、順不同もしくは同時に起こりうる」こと
- Parallel（並列）は、「複数の動作が、物理的に、同時に起こること」
